<h5 id="conventions">Conventions</h5>
<p>It is a fact that programmers can spend more time reading code written by others than creating it from scratch. That is why it is so important to write clearly and concisely. If you have a team of developers, every line of code should be uniform. In this case, it will be easy to read.</p>
<p><strong>Code style conventions</strong> can help you standardize and maintain well-readable code. They are more like recommendations than a set of strict rules. If developers follow them, their code becomes steady and consistent.</p>
<p>Every major programming language has those conventions, and Kotlin is no different. You can find them in the <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Official Documentation</a>. We follow them in all our examples and exercises. Try to stick to them, too. There is no need to learn all conventions at once. You can open them from time to time after learning new concepts. We will also supply you with some important parts of these conventions in our topics.</p>

<p>Let's learn a few code conventions for Kotlin:</p>
<ol><li><p>Use <strong>4 spaces</strong> for <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, indentation refers to the use of whitespace to denote the structure of code. | It is used to indicate the grouping of statements and expressions, and to improve the readability of the code. For example, blocks of code are enclosed in curly braces, and the opening brace is placed on the same line as the keyword that introduces the block, while the closing brace is placed on a new line and indented to align with the keyword. Similarly, if-else statements and other control structures are also indented to show their hierarchy and relationship to other parts of the code.">indentation</a> instead of one tab. Depending on the operating system and different IDEs, one tab does not always correspond to four spaces;</p></li><li><p>Omit semicolon ( ; ). <strong>Kotlin</strong> doesn't need that;</p></li><li><p>Put opening <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4419" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, curly braces `{}` are used to denote a block of code, which can contain zero or more statements. | They are also used in string templates to evaluate complex expressions or object properties. If the expression is more complex, curly braces can be used around the expression following the dollar sign `$`. It is a good practice to always use curly braces for expressions in string templates to avoid mistakes and improve code readability.">curly brace</a> at the <strong>end </strong>of the line;</p></li><li><p>Put closing curly brace at the <strong>beginning </strong>of the next line.</p></li></ol>
<p>For example, the program below follows those rules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() { // opening curly brace
    println("Hi") // this statement is offset by 4 spaces and has no `;` at the end
} // closing brace</code></pre>
<p>A good rule would be to add a space before opening curly brace after <code class="language-kotlin">main()</code>.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Congratulations, these were your first conventions! Carry on, and you'll always end up with wonderful code. Remember that good code is like a good joke â€” it needs no explanation.</p>
