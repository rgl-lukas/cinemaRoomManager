<h5 id="comparing-integer-numbers">Comparing integer numbers</h5>
<p>Relational operators allow you to compare two integer numbers, among other things. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val one = 1
val two = 2
val three = 3
val four = 4

val oneIsOne = one == one // true

val res1 = two &lt;= three // true
val res2 = two != four  // true
val res3 = two &gt; four   // false
val res4 = one == three // false</code></pre>
<p>You can use relational operators together with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4525" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, arithmetic operators are symbols used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo division. | These operators take two values or variables, also known as operands, as inputs and produce a single output. For example, in the expression 1 + 3, 1 and 3 are the operands, and + is the operator. Multiplication has a higher priority than addition or subtraction, meaning it is calculated first. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and simplify the notation. For instance, the program below prints all digits of a number in reverse order using arithmetic operations to extract the digits. The divide operator in Kotlin is denoted by the forward slash (/). It performs division on two numbers and returns the quotient.">arithmetic operators</a>. In these expressions, relational operators have a lower priority than arithmetic operators.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the example below. First, Kotlin calculates two sums, and after that, they are compared with the <code class="language-kotlin">&gt;</code> operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">val number = 1000
val result = number + 10 &gt; number + 9 // 1010 &gt; 1009 is true</code></pre>
<p>The result is <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>.</p>
<p>Note that you cannot check the equality of <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Long</code>! You can compare <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Long</code> freely with <code class="language-kotlin">&gt;</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">&lt;</code>. <code class="language-kotlin">&gt;=</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">&lt;=</code>, but cannot use <code class="language-kotlin">==</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">!=</code>. You can check equality only for the same types, so you need to convert <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code> to <code class="language-kotlin">Long</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val one: Long = 1
val zero: Int = 0

println(one &gt;= zero)          // OK, prints true  
// println(one == zero)          Error
println(one == zero.toLong()) // OK, prints false</code></pre>
<h5 id="joining-relational-operations">Joining relational operations</h5>
<p>Kotlin cannot process <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4525" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. | It can be a simple literal value, a variable, a function call, or a more complex combination of these elements using operators or other language constructs. Expressions are used to compute and return values from functions, assign values to variables, and perform calculations or operations in conditionals. For example, 2 \* 2 is an expression, and it produces a single value.">expressions</a> like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">a &lt;= b &lt;= c</code></pre>
<p>You should join two Boolean expressions using logical operators like <code class="language-kotlin">||</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">&amp;&amp;</code> instead.</p>
<p>For example, let's say we need to check the validity of the following expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">100 &lt; number &lt; 200</code></pre>
<p>To do that, we should write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">number &gt; 100 &amp;&amp; number &lt; 200</code></pre>
<p>Also, we can put different parts of the expression in the parentheses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">(number &gt; 100) &amp;&amp; (number &lt; 200)</code></pre>
<p>The parentheses are not necessary, though, as relational operators have a higher priority.</p>
<p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4525" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a logical operator is a type of operator used to combine one or more boolean values and provide a resulting boolean value. | There are four main logical operators in Kotlin: not, exclusive or (xor), and, and or. Logical operators allow you to join a sequence of relational operations in a single expression. They have a higher priority than relational operators.

<p>As a more complex example, let's write a program that reads an integer number and checks whether a number belongs to the following range — <code class="language-kotlin">[100; 200]</code><strong> </strong>including 100 and 200:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val left = 100
    val right = 200
    val number = readln().toInt()

    val inRange = number &gt;= left &amp;&amp; number &lt;= right // joining two expressions using AND

    println(inRange)
}</code></pre>
<p>You can have something like this:</p>
<ul><li><p>50 results in <code class="language-kotlin">false</code></p></li><li><p>99 results in <code class="language-kotlin">false</code></p></li><li><p>100 results in <code class="language-kotlin">true</code></p></li><li><p>200 results in <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>, and so on.</p></li></ul>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we discussed a couple of very useful relational operators — <code class="language-kotlin">==</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">!=</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">&gt;</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">&gt;=</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">&lt;</code>, and <code class="language-kotlin">&lt;=</code>. You can construct difficult statements by joining them with logical operators. But remember, they will always result in a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4525" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a boolean value is a special data type that can only take two possible values: true or false. | They are often used to represent two opposite states, such as whether a store is open or closed.
