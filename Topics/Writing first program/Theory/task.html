<p>In this lesson, you will write your first Kotlin program, which prints <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> This is the first step that every beginner is to take. Although the program itself is very simple, it is still a working program, and it shows the basic syntax of the programming language.</p>
<h5 id="hello-world">Hello, World</h5>
<p>Here it comes. Below is the source code of this program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    println("Hello, World!")
}</code></pre>
<p>If you have already installed a programming environment on your computer, you may run the program there. If not, do not worry. We will get back to this.</p>

<p>Now, let's learn the basic terminology and then try to understand our program.</p>
<ul><li><p>A<strong> program </strong>is<strong> </strong>a sequence of instructions (called statements), which are executed one after another in a predictable manner.

Programming statements are executed one after another in a predictable sequence, forming the building blocks of a program.

<h5 id="the-hello-world-program-under-a-microscope">The Hello World program under a microscope</h5>
<p>The <strong>Hello World</strong> program illustrates the use of the basic elements of any Kotlin program. Right now, we will consider only the most important ones.</p>
<p><strong>The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4362" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an entry point is a special function that serves as the starting point for program execution. | This function is named 'main' and must always have the same name, as any other name will prevent the program from starting. The 'main' function contains a body enclosed in braces, within which programming statements define what the program should do. For example, the 'main' function may print a string, such as hello, world! to the console. It is the entry point of a Kotlin program and is a fundamental concept in programming with Kotlin.">entry point</a>.</strong> The keyword <code class="language-kotlin">fun</code> defines a function that contains a piece of code to execute. This function has a special name <code class="language-kotlin">main</code>. It indicates the entry point of a Kotlin program. The function has a body enclosed in braces <code class="language-kotlin">{...}</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() { 
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>We will discuss the functions later. The name of this function must always be the same: <code class="language-kotlin">main</code>. If you name it <code class="language-kotlin">Main</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">MAIN</code> or something else, the program will not start.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p><strong>Note: </strong>The text after <code class="language-kotlin">//</code> is just a comment, not a part of the code. Further, we will learn how to write comments.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Printing "Hello, World!".</strong> The body of this function consists of programming statements that define what the program is to do. Our program prints the string <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> using the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">println("Hello, World!")</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the most important things to understand about the <strong>Hello World</strong> program. We invoke the function <code class="language-kotlin">println</code> to display a string followed by a new line on the screen. We will often use this way to print something.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p><strong>Remember</strong> that <code class="language-kotlin">"Hello, World!"</code> is not a keyword or a name, it is just a string literal to be printed on the screen.</p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="programs-with-multiple-statements">Programs with multiple statements</h5>
<p>As a rule, a program contains multiple statements. You should start a new line to write each statement. For example, the program below has two statements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    println("Hello")
    println("World")
}</code></pre>
<p>If you run the program, you will see that it displays this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">Hello
World
</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Congratulations! We have written our first program, which prints <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong> It has one function named <code class="language-kotlin">main</code>, which represents the entry point of this program. Don't worry about all those terms (<strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4362" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a syntax refers to the set of rules and conventions that dictate how a program should be written in the language. | It includes the structure of statements, expressions, and keywords, as well as the use of indentation, whitespace, and comments. An expression, for example, is a type of syntax that evaluates to a single value, such as a literal value, variable, function call, or a combination of these elements using operators. Understanding the syntax of Kotlin is essential for writing clear, maintainable, and error-free code.">syntax</a></strong>, <strong>statement</strong>, <strong>block</strong>) for now – we will explain them throughout this course.
