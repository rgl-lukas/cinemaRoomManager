<p>A string is just a sequence of characters enclosed in double-quotes. In Kotlin, strings are represented by the <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> type. It is one of the most widely used <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12561" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a data type is a classification that specifies the kind of value that a variable, expression, or function parameter can hold. | It is an essential aspect of a statically-typed language like Kotlin, which requires explicit or implicit type declarations for variables and function parameters. For instance, Kotlin has various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, booleans, and strings. Among these, strings are a widely-used data type that represents a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed by double quotes. Strings are often used in conditional statements and regular expressions, and they have various operations, such as getting the length or concatenating two strings. Moreover, type inference is a helpful feature in Kotlin that allows the compiler to deduce the data type of a variable, expression, or function parameter automatically, making the code more concise and readable.">data types</a> in practice. In this topic, we will learn some operations with strings.</p>
<h5 id="accessing-characters" style="text-align: center;">Accessing characters</h5>
<p>The elements of a string are individual characters that can be accessed by their index. The first element of a string has an index of <span class="math-tex">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val greeting = "Hello"

val first = greeting[0]  // 'H'
val second = greeting[1] // 'e'
val five = greeting[4]   // 'o'</code></pre>
<p>The last element has the index that equals the length of the string minus 1. For the string <code class="language-kotlin">"Hello"</code>, the last element is <code class="language-kotlin">'o'</code>. Its index is 4 because the string's length is 5.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val last = greeting[greeting.length - 1] // 'o'
val prelast = greeting[greeting.length - 2] // 'l'</code></pre>
<p>Kotlin provides several convenient ways to access the first and the last character of a string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(greeting.first())   // 'H'
println(greeting.last())    // 'o'
println(greeting.lastIndex) // 4</code></pre>
<p>You can use this feature to write more readable code.</p>
<h5 id="empty-string" style="text-align: center;">Empty string</h5>
<p>Sometimes you need a fast way to check if the <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> is empty. For example, you need the first element of the string and want to check for its existence. Of course, you can use the length and check if it's greater than 0. But a much more elegant way is using the function <code class="language-kotlin">isEmpty()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val emptyString = ""
println(emptyString.length == 0) //true
println(emptyString.isEmpty()) //true</code></pre>
<h5 id="immutability" style="text-align: center;">Immutability</h5>
<p>Strings are <strong>immutable</strong>,<strong> </strong>meaning that once created, the string stays the same. You cannot modify an element of a string. So, the example below would not work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val valString = "string"
valString[3] = 'o' // an error here!
var varString = "string"
varString[3] = 'o' // an error here too!</code></pre>
<p>If you need to change the string, you can reassign it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var varString = "string"
varString = "strong" // legal
val valString = "string"
valString = "strong" // error, you cannot reassign val</code></pre>
<p>Actually, we do not modify the stored value in the <code class="language-kotlin">varString</code> variable. Instead, we assign a new value to it. So, it is absolutely legal. This is one of the ways to work with strings. If you need to modify a string, just create a new one.</p>
<h5 id="comparing-strings" style="text-align: center;"> Comparing strings</h5>
<p>To compare two strings, use <code class="language-kotlin">==</code> (equals) and <code class="language-kotlin">!=</code> (not equals) operators. Both operators take two strings as their <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/12561" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an operand is a value or variable that an operator is being applied to. | For example, in the expression 1 + 3, 1 and 3 are the operands and + is the operator. Operands can be either literals, variables, or more complex expressions. In Kotlin, there are five arithmetic operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). These operators are binary, meaning they take two operands. Operands are evaluated and the operator is applied according to a set of rules called operator precedence.">operands</a> and return a value of the <code class="language-kotlin">Boolean</code> type (<code class="language-kotlin">true</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">false</code>).</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val first = "first"
val second = "second"
var str = "first"

println(first == str)    // true
println(first == second) // false
println(first != second) // true</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, you learned how to get a single character from a string and how to compare strings. Remember that strings are immutable, and in order to change a string, you need to reassign it. Good luck with your tasks, and have a nice Kotlin!</p>
