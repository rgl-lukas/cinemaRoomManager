<p>There are several ways to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>. In this topic, we will learn how to do it with two loops: <code class="language-kotlin">while</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">do...while</code>. The difference between them is the repetition order and the evaluation of the condition.</p>
<h5 id="while-loop">While loop</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">while</code> loop includes a block of code and a <strong>condition</strong>,<strong> </strong>which is a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4659" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a boolean expression is a type of expression that evaluates to a boolean value, either true or false. | These expressions are often used in programming to make decisions based on two boolean conditions. They can include logical operators such as 'not', 'and', 'or', and 'xor' that allow for complex value matching and can help make the code easier to understand. In Kotlin, boolean values are often used to represent two opposite states, such as whether a store is open or closed, and they can only take on two possible values: true or false.">boolean expression</a></strong>. If the condition is <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>, the loop initiates the statements. They are repeated until the condition becomes <code class="language-kotlin">false</code>. This loop checks the condition <strong>before </strong>the execution, so it is also known as a <strong>pre-<a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4659" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a test is a piece of code that verifies the correctness of a specific functionality or unit of your code. | JUnit5 is a popular framework used to write tests in a structured and readable way. Instead of writing multiple test methods, you can have a single method that takes parameters, allowing you to supply different arguments and reuse your code efficiently. This is particularly useful when testing units of code with complex logic and a large number of execution paths. JUnit5 provides several options to set up argument sources for your tests, such as @Param, @CsvFileSource, and @MethodSource. By combining different sources, you can use a set of input data of any size to cover many test cases. This allows for testing units of code with complex logic and a large number of execution paths, which would otherwise be difficult to test reliably. In addition, JUnit5 creates a new instance of the test class before executing each test, ensuring that each test starts with a clean slate.">test</a> loop</strong>. Take a look at the example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">while (condition) {
    // body: do something repetitive
}</code></pre>
<p>The loop body can contain any kind of statement: declaring variables, reading data from the standard input, conditional expressions, and even nested loops.</p>
<p>You can also write an <strong>infinite loop</strong> if the condition remains <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">while (true) {
    // body: do something indefinitely
}</code></pre>
<p>We will take a closer look at <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4659" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an infinite loop is a loop that continues to execute indefinitely because its condition never becomes false. | This can occur when the condition is always true or when there is no condition specified. In the context of the provided information, an infinite loop can be created if the condition remains unchanged, causing the loop to repeat endlessly. For instance, when a variable is not modified inside the loop, and its initial value fulfills the loop's condition. This can be useful in specific scenarios, such as when a program needs to run continuously until manually stopped.">infinite loops</a> later.</p>
<p>For now, consider the example below. The program uses a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4659" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. | The condition is evaluated before each iteration, making it a pre-test loop. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed, and this process continues until the condition becomes false. An example of a while loop in Kotlin is:

`while (condition) {`
`// loop body`
`}`

In this example, the loop body will be executed repeatedly as long as the value of the condition is true. If the condition is false, the loop will be terminated, and the program will continue with the next statement following the loop. It is important to note that if the condition is always true, the loop will become an infinite loop, and the program will get stuck in an endless loop.">while loop</a> to print integer numbers only when the variable is less than <code class="language-kotlin">5</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    var i = 0

    while (i &lt; 5) {
        println(i)
        i++
    }

    println("Completed")
}</code></pre>
<p>Let us explain the work behind this loop. First, <code class="language-kotlin">0</code> is assigned to the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4659" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a mutable variable is a variable that can be changed or modified after it has been declared and initialized. | It is declared using the `var` keyword, which allows for reassignment of a new value to the variable. This is in contrast to an immutable variable, which is declared using the `val` keyword and cannot be changed once it has been initialized. It is important to note that mutable does not mean the same as immutable. For example, the content of a mutable variable can be changed many times if needed, but it is not possible to reassign the variable itself. However, it is always possible to change the internal state of a mutable variable.">mutable variable</a> <code class="language-kotlin">i</code>. Before the first execution of the loop, the program checks whether the expression <code class="language-kotlin">i &lt; 5</code> is <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>. As <code class="language-kotlin">i</code> is 0, the loop is activated. The loop body has two statements: first, it displays the current value of <code class="language-kotlin">i</code> and second, it increments it by <code class="language-kotlin">1</code>. After this, the expression <code class="language-kotlin">i &lt; 5</code> is evaluated again. The <code class="language-kotlin">i</code> becomes <code class="language-kotlin">1</code>; it is also <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>, so the process repeats. It keeps happening until <code class="language-kotlin">i</code> becomes <code class="language-kotlin">5</code>. <code class="language-kotlin">i &lt; 5</code> becomes <code class="language-kotlin">false</code>, so the execution of this loop terminates. The program proceeds to the next statement and prints <code class="language-kotlin">Completed</code>. This is the output of the loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">0
1
2
3
4
Completed</code></pre>
<p>Loops can be used to process characters, strings, and any other data types. The program below displays English letters in a single line.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    var letter = 'A'
    
    while (letter &lt;= 'Z') {
        print(letter)
        letter++
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The program takes the first letter <code class="language-kotlin">A</code> and then executes the loop until the letter becomes <code class="language-kotlin">Z</code>. The program also prints the current character and goes on to the next one. So the output is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to get the next character (according to the Unicode table) using the increment operator.</p>
<p>Our third example contains a program that reads any number of words from the standard input and then prints them. It uses the <code class="language-kotlin">hasNext</code> function of <code class="language-kotlin">Scanner</code> to check whether the input has a value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.util.*

fun main() {
    val scanner = Scanner(System.`in`)
    while (scanner.hasNext()) {
        val next = scanner.next()
        println(next)
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Kotlin is a modern language</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Kotlin
is
a
modern
language</code></pre>
<p>Use <code class="language-kotlin">scanner.hasNext()</code> for strings and <code class="language-kotlin">scanner.hasNextInt()</code> for integers when you do not know the size of your input data. Note that you can stop input in the console in IDEA by pressing <strong>Ctrl+D</strong>. </p>
<h5 id="dowhile-loop">Do...while loop</h5>
<p>A <code class="language-kotlin">do...while</code> loop is executed first, after that the program tests a condition. If the condition is <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>, it repeats the loop until the condition becomes <code class="language-kotlin">false</code>. Since <code class="language-kotlin">do...while</code> loops check the condition after execution, the loop is also known as a <strong>post-test loop</strong>. In contrast with the <code class="language-kotlin">while</code> loop, which tests the condition before the execution, the <code class="language-kotlin">do..while</code> loop is an exit-condition loop. So, the body is always executed at least once.</p>
<p>This loop contains three parts: the <code class="language-kotlin">do</code> keyword, a body, and <code class="language-kotlin">while(condition)</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">do {
    // body: do something
} while (condition)</code></pre>
<p>The program below reads an integer number from the standard input and displays the number. If a user enters <code class="language-kotlin">0</code>, the program prints it and then stops. The example below shows the work of the loop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    do {
        val n = readln().toInt()
        println(n)
    } while (n &gt; 0)
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"><p>You can set a variable in the loop body and then use it in the condition.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1
2
4
0</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">1
2
4
0</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-kotlin">do...while</code> loop can also be infinite just like the <code class="language-kotlin">while</code> loop.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we have covered two basic but very useful loops: <code class="language-kotlin">while</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">do...while</code>. They both have a body and a condition, the only difference being the order of their execution. A <code class="language-kotlin">while</code> loop checks a condition before the body execution, a <code class="language-kotlin">do...while</code> loop checks it after the first execution.</p>
<p>In practice, programmers do not use <code class="language-kotlin">do..while</code> as often as <code class="language-kotlin">while</code>. A good example of using this loop is a program that reads data from the standard input until a user enters a certain number or a string. Now you know the basics of these loops. Let's practice!</p>
