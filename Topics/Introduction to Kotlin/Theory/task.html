<h5 id="what-is-kotlin">What is Kotlin?</h5>
<p>Kotlin is a highly effective modern programming language developed by <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JetBrains</a>. It has a very clear and concise syntax, which makes your code easy to read. </p>
<p>Kotlin is widely used around the world, and its popularity among developers is constantly growing. Many developers who use Kotlin note that it makes their work faster and more exciting :)</p>

<p>The basic <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4350" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a syntax refers to the set of rules and conventions that dictate how a program should be written in the language. | It includes the structure of statements, expressions, and keywords, as well as the use of indentation, whitespace, and comments. An expression, for example, is a type of syntax that evaluates to a single value, such as a literal value, variable, function call, or a combination of these elements using operators. Understanding the syntax of Kotlin is essential for writing clear, maintainable, and error-free code.">syntax</a> of Kotlin is similar to Java, but it has numerous important differences. One of these features is extension features, which offer developers the ability to extend the functionality of classes without having to use inheritance. Moreover, Kotlin offers <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4350" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, type inference is the process where the compiler automatically deduces the data type of a variable, expression, or function parameter, without requiring explicit type declaration. | This feature is particularly useful in lambda expressions, where the parameter type is inferred from the interface, making the code easier to read. Kotlin's type inference works seamlessly with Java's functional interface, allowing for smooth interoperability between the two. Type inference helps to reduce redundancy in the code and makes it more concise, as the programmer does not have to explicitly specify the type of the variable every time.">type inference</a>, allowing the compiler to determine the type of variable based on context, which simplifies coding and reduces the number of errors in complex programs.</p>
<h5 id="a-brief-history-of-kotlin">A brief history of Kotlin</h5>
<p>In July 2011, JetBrains unveiled the Kotlin Project, a new language for the Java Platform, which had been in development for a year. The name comes from Kotlin Island near St. Petersburg, Russia. The primary goal of this project was to provide a safer and more concise alternative to Java in all the contexts where Java is currently used.</p>
<p>In 2016, the first official stable version was released (Kotlin v1.0). The developer community was already interested in using this language, especially on Android.</p>
<p>At the Google I/O 2017 conference, Google announced first-class support for Kotlin on Android. Chet Haase, the chief advocate for Android, said: "We understand that not everybody is on Kotlin right now, but we believe that you should get there".</p>
<p>At this moment, Kotlin is considered as a general-purpose language for many platforms, not only for Android. The language has several releases a year. The latest version can be found <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">on the official site</a>.</p>
<h5 id="a-sample-kotlin-function">A sample Kotlin function</h5>
<p>Here is a sample of a simple function in Kotlin programming language that prints <code class="language-kotlin">Hello, Kotlin!</code>. </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    println("Hello, Kotlin!")
}</code></pre>
<p>For now, you do not need to understand how this function works, just enjoy it! :)</p>
<h5 id="application-platforms-for-kotlin-jvm-android-js-native">Application platforms for Kotlin: JVM, Android, JS, Native</h5>
<p>Kotlin can be used in a variety of application platforms, such as JVM (Java Virtual Machine), Android, JavaScript, and Native. It is known for its flexibility and ease-of-use when it comes to developing software for different platforms.</p>
<p>For example, developers who are familiar with Java can easily learn how to use Kotlin on Android devices. The same is true for developers who are familiar with JavaScript and want to develop applications for the web using Kotlin.</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">JVM</a>: Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, which means Kotlin works great with all existing Java <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4350" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a source code is a set of instructions and statements written in the Kotlin programming language. | These instructions are used to create programs, functions, and data structures. Source code can include various elements such as keywords, identifiers, expressions, blocks, and comments. Keywords are reserved words that have special meanings in the language, while identifiers are names given to variables, functions, and classes. Expressions are pieces of code that produce a single value, and blocks are groups of statements enclosed in curly braces. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are used to explain parts of the code.">source code</a> and libraries. It also allows companies to make a gradual migration from Java to Kotlin because Java code can access Kotlin code, too.

<p>Among all these opportunities, modern programmers prefer mobile and server-side development, but other areas are gaining popularity as well.</p>
<h5 id="features-functional-programming-object-oriented-programming-and-more">Features: functional programming, object-oriented programming and more</h5>
<p>Kotlin is designed as a pragmatic language, which means that its main purpose is solving real-world problems rather than completing research purposes. </p>
<p>It is also important that Kotlin supports multiple programming paradigms, such as imperative programming, object-oriented programming, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4350" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, generic programming is a way of writing more abstract and reusable code by using type parameters in a class or function. | A generic class is declared with one or more type parameters in angle brackets after the class name, and these type parameters can be used in the class body for field types, method arguments, and return values. The class itself does not depend on the type it operates on; the type is relevant only when creating an instance of the class. Generic programming allows for versatility and the creation of reusable code.">generic programming</a>, <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4350" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, functional programming is a style of programming that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. | It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions. The Kotlin standard library provides many functions for collections, such as `filter`, `map`, and `reduce`, which are commonly used in functional programming. These functions allow you to process and transform data in a declarative way, without changing the original data.">functional programming</a>, and more. Kotlin also offers tools like <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4350" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an anonymous function is a function that is declared without a name and does not have its own identity. | It is created at runtime and can be passed around like a variable. Anonymous functions are useful for creating function objects, implementing event listeners, managing asynchronous tasks, and working with collections. They can be defined in line or through well-named functions, which improves code readability. Anonymous functions can be created using either an anonymous function or a lambda expression. They are first-class citizens in Kotlin, meaning they can be used as arguments, returned by functions, and assigned to variables.">anonymous functions</a> and <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4350" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a higher-order function is a function that can take one or more functions as parameters or return a function as its result. | This feature allows for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code, as it promotes functional programming patterns and prevents issues with shared state in concurrent environments. Higher-order functions can be used to simplify complex situations and enhance code organization through functional decomposition. They are an essential part of Kotlin's support for functional programming, along with other features like lambda expressions, anonymous functions, and monads.">higher-order functions</a>, which allow developers to easily create abstractions over existing code.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Kotlin is a tool-friendly language, which means all popular types of development tools, such as <u>IntelliJ IDEA</u>, <u>Eclipse</u>, and <u>Android Studio</u>, are compatible with it.</p>
