<p></p><p>Arrange the operations in the following code according to their execution order based on their precedence:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
   var a = 5
   val b = 9
   val c = 11
   var d = 1
   d *= ++a + b%(c - 3) // order of execution in this line
   println(d)   
}</code></pre><p>Remember, the operations are executed from left to right, however parentheses are very important! If you run into difficulties, please revisit the "Order of Precedence" section in the theory.</p>
