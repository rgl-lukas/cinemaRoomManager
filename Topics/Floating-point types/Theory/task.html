<p>We often use real numbers to perform calculations in science, statistics, engineering, and other fields. Kotlin has two basic types to represent real numbers: <code class="language-kotlin">Float</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code>. They are called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4502" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a floating-point type is a data type that represents real numbers with a fractional part. | There are two such types in Kotlin: `Float` (32-bit) and `Double` (64-bit). These types can store a limited number of decimal digits (~6-7 for `Float` and ~14-16 for `Double`). Floating-point types are essential for mathematical operations involving decimal values. It's worth noting that due to the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary, certain arithmetic operations can result in errors during computation. To display the maximum and minimum value of a numeric type, including `Float` and `Double`, you can write the type name followed by a dot and then either `MIN_VALUE` or `MAX_VALUE`.">floating-point types</a></strong>. In fact, these types cannot represent an arbitrary real number because they support only a limited number of significant decimal digits (6-7 for <code class="language-kotlin">Float</code> and 14-16 for <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code>). In addition, <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code> can represent a wider number range than <code class="language-kotlin">Float</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, programmers mostly use the <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code> type. We will discuss this type, and we do recommend using it to solve our code challenges. However, all the information below is true for the <code class="language-kotlin">Float</code> type as well.</p>
<h5 id="floating-point-arithmetic-operations">Floating-point arithmetic operations</h5>
<p>It is easy to create a variable of a <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code> type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val one = 1.0
val negNumber = -1.75

val pi = 3.1415</code></pre>
<p>If you want to create a <code class="language-kotlin">Float</code>, make the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val b: Float = 8.75f

val e = 2.71828f</code></pre>
<p><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4502" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, arithmetic operations are mathematical calculations performed on numerical values using specific operators. | There are five arithmetic operators in Kotlin: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulo (%). These operators are binary, meaning they take two operands, which are the values or variables the operator is being applied to. For example, in the expression 1 + 3, 1 and 3 are the operands, and + is the operator. Arithmetic operations in Kotlin follow specific rules, such as multiplication having a higher priority than addition or subtraction. Parentheses can be used to specify the order of execution and simplify notation. Additionally, Kotlin supports compound assignment operations that combine arithmetic operations and assignment, such as assignment after addition (a += b) and assignment after subtraction (a -= b).">Arithmetic operations</a> with <code class="language-kotlin">Doubles</code> can be performed like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val number = one + 1.5 // 2.5
val c = b + negNumber  // 7, Double, the type is inferred from the context

val squaredPi = pi * pi // 9.86902225</code></pre>
<p>For fractional operands, the operator <code class="language-kotlin">/</code> performs division with a remainder, not integer division.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(squaredPi / 2) // prints 4.934511125</code></pre>
<h5 id="errors-during-computation">Errors during computation</h5>
<p>Be careful — operations with floating-point numbers can produce an inaccurate result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">println(3.3 / 3) // prints 1.0999999999999999</code></pre>
<p>Errors can accumulate during computation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">val num = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
println(num) // it prints 0.9999999999999999</code></pre>
<p>In the following topics, we will find out how to deal with this problem, but for now, just consider it.</p>
<h5 id="reading-numbers">Reading numbers</h5>
<p>You can use <code class="language-kotlin">readln()</code> to read <code class="language-kotlin">Doubles</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Floats</code> from the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4502" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a standard input is a stream of data that goes into a program, supported by the operating system. | It typically obtains data from the keyboard, but can also be obtained from a file. While not all programs need to use standard input, it is still commonly used. The standard input is often used in a typical problem-solving approach of reading data from the standard input, processing it to obtain a result, and outputting the result to the standard output. In Kotlin, to read data from the standard input, you can use the `readLine()` function, which reads the whole line as a string.">standard input</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val f = readln().toFloat()  // Float
val d = readln().toDouble() // Double</code></pre>
<p>For example, consider a program that calculates a triangle area. To find it, the program reads the <code class="language-kotlin">base</code> and the <code class="language-kotlin">height</code> from the standard input, then multiplies them and divides the result by 2. Note that the base and the height are perpendicular to each other.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val base = readln().toDouble()
    val height = readln().toDouble()

    val area = (base * height) / 2

    println(area)
}</code></pre>
<p>Let's calculate the area of a triangle with the base of <code class="language-kotlin">3.3</code> and the height of <code class="language-kotlin">4.5</code>:</p>
<p><strong>Input 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">3.3
4.5</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">7.425</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that the output of this program may contain a lot of zeroes like the output below because an operation with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4502" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a floating-point number is a type of number that can represent real numbers with a high degree of precision. | It is a 64-bit data type, represented by the keyword 'double', that can store a wide range of decimal values, both positive and negative. Floating-point numbers are essential for mathematical operations that involve decimal values. They are used to represent real numbers in programming and are different from whole numbers, which are represented by the 'Int' type in Kotlin.">floating-point numbers</a> can produce inaccurate results. As you may know, the computer works with binary numbers and often floating-point numbers cannot be represented finitely in base 2. So, we work with inexact numbers, and this leads to the imprecise result :</p>
<p><strong>Input 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">2.2 4.01</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">4.4110000000000005</code></pre>
<p>It is possible to round or format a double result, but we will discuss it later.</p>
<h5 id="decimal-separator">Decimal separator</h5>
<p>It is crucial to use the correct decimal separator. The separator is locale-dependent, such as a dot for the US locale. If you happen to employ any other character, it may crash your program. If you work with another locale and want to use the dot character, you can use this construction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">import java.util.Locale

val floatNum = readln().format(Locale.US).toFloat()</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>In this topic, we have discussed the two main floating-point types in Kotlin — <code class="language-kotlin">Float</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code>. There are subtle differences between them, but they share one common feature — you can use them for carrying out arithmetic operations with floating-point numbers. Remember, floating-point types may produce inaccurate results, so account for that. And don't forget about the correct decimal separator, too!</p>
