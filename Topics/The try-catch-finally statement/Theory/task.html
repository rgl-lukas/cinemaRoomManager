<p>Youâ€™re already pretty good at catching exceptions. In this topic, we will go through a few more features that will help you with handling exceptions in Kotlin.</p>
<h5 id="the-finally-block" style="text-align: center;">The finally block</h5>
<p>As you already know, you can use the <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a statement is a single command to be executed, such as printing a text or assigning a value to a variable. | Unlike expressions, which produce a single value as a result of computation, statements are standalone commands that have a side effect, like changing the state of the program. The result of a statement is not used in the program, whereas the result of an expression often is. For example, in the statement `val x = 2 * 2`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is assigned to the variable `x`. However, the result of the statement itself is not used in the program. In contrast, if you write `println(2 * 2)`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is passed directly to the `println` function, which then prints the result. It's important to note that a statement can be an expression, but not all expressions are statements. For instance, `2 * 2` is an expression, but it's not a statement because it doesn't change the state of the program.">statement</a> to <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, handle exception refers to the process of dealing with and responding to exceptions during the execution of a program. | This is done using the `try` and `catch` keywords. The `try` block contains the code that may throw an exception, while the `catch` block contains the action to be taken when an exception occurs. When an exception occurs in the `try` block, the runtime system determines the first suitable `catch` block to handle it, starting from the top. It is best to handle exceptions in a method that has sufficient information to make the correct decision based on the exception.">handle exceptions</a> in Kotlin. Actually, there is another possible block called <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code>. All the statements present in this block will always execute regardless of whether an exception occurs in the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block or not. </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">try {
    // code that may throw an exception
}
catch (e: Exception) {
    // exception handler
}
finally {
    // code is always executed
}</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block is executed after the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block. You will find <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> helpful in situations when you need to perform some finishing actions regardless of whether an exception is thrown. For example, an exception could occur when you're working with a file: then, in the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> statement, you can write the closing of this file.</p>
<h5 id="three-magic-words" style="text-align: center;">Three magic words</h5>
<p>Take a careful look at the example below: it illustrates the order of execution of the <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch-finally</code> statement.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">try {
    println("Inside the try block")
    println(2 / 0) // throws ArithmeticException
}
catch (e: Exception) {
    println("Inside the catch block")
}
finally {
    println("Inside the finally block")
}

println("After the try-catch-finally block")</code></pre>
<p>The output will be the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Inside the try block
Inside the catch block
Inside the finally block
After the try-catch-finally block</code></pre>
<p>If we remove the line that throws the <code class="language-kotlin">ArithmeticException</code>, the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block will still execute after the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Inside the try block
Inside the finally block
After the try-catch-finally block</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps you have a question: why do you need the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block at all, if you can just write the code after <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch</code>? For a better understanding, take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    try {
        val a = 0/0 // throws ArithmeticException
    }
    finally {
        println("End of the try block") // will be executed
    }
    println("End of the program") // will not be printed
}</code></pre>
<p>After the exception is thrown, the line that prints "End of the program", which is located after <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch</code>, will not run. By contrast, the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, the `finally` keyword is used in the `try-catch-finally` statement to enclose a block of code that is guaranteed to be executed after the `try` and `catch` blocks, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. | This is useful for cleaning up resources or performing other necessary tasks before exiting a function or a block of code. It's important to note that the `finally` block is always executed, even if a `return` statement is encountered in the `try` or `catch` blocks.">finally</a> block will <strong>always</strong> be executed.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary">Note that the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block is executed even if an exception occurs in the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block.</div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="omitting-blocks" style="text-align: center;">Omitting blocks</h5>
<p>It is also possible to write <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> without a <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">try {
    // code that may throw an exception
} 
finally {   
    // code will always be executed
}</code></pre>
<p>In this template, the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block is executed right after the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block.</p>
<p>So, the code can contain any number of <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> blocks or no such blocks at all, and <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> blocks can be omitted. However, <strong>at least one</strong> <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block must be present. This means that when you handle an exception with <code class="language-kotlin">try</code>, you should add at least one other block: <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code>. Otherwise, the statement simply won't work. </p>
<h5 id="try-is-an-expression" style="text-align: center;">Try is an expression</h5>
<p>Unlike in Java and many other languages, <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> can be an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. | It can be a simple literal value, a variable, a function call, or a more complex combination of these elements using operators or other language constructs. Expressions are used to compute and return values from functions, assign values to variables, and perform calculations or operations in conditionals. For example, 2 \* 2 is an expression, and it produces a single value.">expression</a> in Kotlin. This means that it may have a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/11809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a return value is the result produced by a function after it has completed its execution. | It is determined by the last expression in the function's body, which must be an expression-style statement. If a function has a specified return type, it indicates that the function will not return a value under any circumstance, such as when it throws an exception or enters an infinite loop. Understanding return values is important for writing clean, readable, and robust code in Kotlin.">return value</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val number: Int = try { "abc".toInt() } catch (e: NumberFormatException) { 0 }
println(number) // 0</code></pre>
<p>In the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block, we're trying to assign the value "abc" to the variable <code class="language-kotlin">number</code>.</p>
<p>When we attempt to convert the string "abc" to the <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code> type, the <code class="language-kotlin">NumberFormatException</code> is thrown. Then, the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block is executed, so the <code class="language-kotlin">number</code> variable takes the value <samp>0</samp>.</p>
<p>The returned value of a <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> expression is either the last expression in the <code class="language-kotlin">try</code> block or the last expression in the <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> block(s). The contents of the <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block do not affect the result of the expression:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val number: Int = try { "2a".toInt() } catch (e: NumberFormatException) { 0 }
finally { println("Inside the finally block") }
println(number)
</code></pre>
<p>The output is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Inside the finally block
0</code></pre>
<p>Another useful technique is to rethrow exceptions to the caller. You need to add a way to handle exceptions in the code snippet where you call the function that can throw an exception. Here is an example of how to do this with an expression-style <code class="language-kotlin">try</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun test() {
    val result = try {
        countSomething()
    } catch (e: ArithmeticException) {
        throw IllegalStateException(e) // do not forget to deal with it
    }

    // Working with result
}


try {
    test()
} catch (e: IllegalStateException) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<h5 id="idiom" style="text-align: center;">Idiom</h5>
<p>Using  <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch</code> blocks as expressions is an <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html#try-catch-expression" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">idiomatic way</a> of working with exceptions in Kotlin. You get the result immediately, which is very convenient. Compare this method with a less direct one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val string = "abc"
val number = try {
    string.toInt()
} catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
    -1
}

...

val string = "abc"
var number = 0 // try to avoid var if possible
try {
    number = string.toInt()
} catch (e: NumberFormatException) {
    number = -1
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion" style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Now you know how to use the full <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch-finally</code> statement by adding a <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> block that executes no matter what the exception does. Remember that you can skip <code class="language-kotlin">catch</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">finally</code> when you handle an exception with <code class="language-kotlin">try</code>, but you can't omit both at the same time. You can also add syntactic sugar to your code as a <code class="language-kotlin">try-catch-finally</code> expression.</p>
