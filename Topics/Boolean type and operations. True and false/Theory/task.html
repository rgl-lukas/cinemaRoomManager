<h5 id="reading-boolean-values">Reading Boolean values</h5>
<p>Since Kotlin 1.4, you can read a Boolean value like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val b: Boolean = readLine().toBoolean()</code></pre>
<p>and since Kotlin 1.6,  you can read a Boolean value like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val b: Boolean = readln().toBoolean()</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">toBoolean()</code> returns <code class="language-kotlin">true</code> if the input is "true", case insensitive. Otherwise, it will return <code class="language-kotlin">false</code>.</p>
<p>So, suppose you have the following input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">true
True
TRuE
T
false</code></pre>
<p>The output will be as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println(readln().toBoolean()) // true
println(readln().toBoolean()) // true
println(readln().toBoolean()) // true
println(readln().toBoolean()) // false
println(readln().toBoolean()) // false</code></pre>
<p>You can use <code class="language-kotlin">readLine()!!.toBoolean()</code> with the Kotlin compiler version 1.3 or older:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val b: Boolean = readLine()!!.toBoolean()</code></pre>
<p>Since Kotlin 1.5, you can use other functions to convert <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> to <code class="language-kotlin">Boolean</code>. The function <code class="language-kotlin">toBooleanStrict()</code> returns <code class="language-kotlin">true</code> if the string is equal to the word "true", case sensitive, and <code class="language-kotlin">false</code> if the string is equal to "false"; otherwise, your program will crash with an <code class="language-kotlin">java.lang.IllegalArgumentException</code>. The function <code class="language-kotlin">toBooleanStrictOrNull()</code> returns <code class="language-kotlin">true</code> if the string is equal to the word "true", case sensitive, and <code class="language-kotlin">false</code> if the string is equal to "false"; otherwise, it returns a special value <code class="language-kotlin">null</code>. We will discuss it later.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">println("true".toBooleanStrict())     // true
// println("True".toBooleanStrict())  // program crashes
println("false".toBooleanStrict())    // false
// println("faLse".toBooleanStrict()) // program crashes

println("true".toBooleanStrictOrNull())  // true
println("false".toBooleanStrictOrNull()) // false
println("faLse".toBooleanStrictOrNull()) // null</code></pre>

<p>Boolean type variables construct logical <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4515" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a statement is a single command to be executed, such as printing a text or assigning a value to a variable. | Unlike expressions, which produce a single value as a result of computation, statements are standalone commands that have a side effect, like changing the state of the program. The result of a statement is not used in the program, whereas the result of an expression often is. For example, in the statement `val x = 2 * 2`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is assigned to the variable `x`. However, the result of the statement itself is not used in the program. In contrast, if you write `println(2 * 2)`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is passed directly to the `println` function, which then prints the result. It's important to note that a statement can be an expression, but not all expressions are statements. For instance, `2 * 2` is an expression, but it's not a statement because it doesn't change the state of the program.">statements</a> with the help of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4515" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a logical operator is a type of operator used to combine one or more boolean values and provide a resulting boolean value. | There are four main logical operators in Kotlin: not, exclusive or (xor), and, and or. Logical operators allow you to join a sequence of relational operations in a single expression. They have a higher priority than relational operators. For example, the expression a &gt; b &amp;&amp; c &lt; d means a is greater than b and c is less than d. Parentheses can be used to change the order of execution.">logical operators</a>.

<ul><li><p>NOT is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4515" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a unary operator is a type of operator that operates on only one operand or value. | It is different from a binary operator, which operates on two operands. Unary operators can be either unary prefix operators, which are placed before the operand (such as the increment and decrement operators), or unary postfix operators, which are placed after the operand. To customize a unary operator in Kotlin, you need to provide a member function or an extension function with a specific name for the corresponding type. This type becomes the left-hand side type for binary operation and the argument type for the unary one. To mark the function as an operator, you should use the `operator` modifier. It is important to note that unary prefix operator expressions are translated to function calls with a single parameter, while increment and decrement expressions are translated to function calls with no parameters. Unary operators are part of operator overloading in Kotlin, which allows you to change the way operators work for a specific type.">unary operator</a> that reverses the Boolean value. It can be denoted with <code class="language-kotlin">!</code>.</p></li></ul>

These operators can be applied to both integer and boolean operands, with different operations performed depending on the data type of the operands. When using binary operators, it is important to consider their precedence, as it determines the order in which operations are performed in the absence of parentheses.">binary operator</a> that returns <code class="language-kotlin">true</code> if both <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4515" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an operand is a value or variable that an operator is being applied to. | For example, in the expression 1 + 3, 1 and 3 are the operands and + is the operator. Operands can be either literals, variables, or more complex expressions. In Kotlin, there are five arithmetic operators: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%). These operators are binary, meaning they take two operands. Operands are evaluated and the operator is applied according to a set of rules called operator precedence.">operands</a> are <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>.

val b2 = false &amp;&amp; true // false
val b3 = true &amp;&amp; false // false
val b4 = true &amp;&amp; true  // true </code></pre>
<ul><li><p>OR is a binary operator that returns <code class="language-kotlin">true</code> if at least one operand is <code class="language-kotlin">true</code>.

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val b1 = false || false // false
val b2 = false || true  // true
val b3 = true || false  // true
val b4 = true || true   // true</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val b1 = false xor false // false
val b2 = false xor true  // true

<p>The XOR operator is not as popular as the other logical operators. But you can still use it, just in case.</p>
<h5 id="logical-operator-precedence">Logical operator precedence</h5>
<p>Take a look at the <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4515" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, precedence refers to the rule that determines the order of performing and grouping operations in an expression. | Operations with higher precedence are performed before those with lower precedence. For example, multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so if you have an expression like 2 + 3 * 4, the multiplication will be performed first, resulting in 14 + 3 = 17. Parentheses can be used to increase the priority of an operation or to make the code clearer. Precedence determines how other variables are grouped in the absence of parentheses. For example, for not, xor, and, or, the grouping of variables is as follows: you can use parentheses to change the order of execution. For instance, when writing a boolean expression that determines the possibility of going on a hike during the summer and in other seasons, a good programmer should understand not only arithmetic rules but also logical operations. This way, you can avoid hiking in bad weather. In this topic, we have discussed the four main Kotlin logical operators: (not), (exclusive or), (and), and (or).">precedence</a></strong> of logical operations in Kotlin below.
